    "- Select specific columns (select) and rename them (withColumnRenamed)\n",
    "- Filter rows based on conditions (e.g., candidates above a certain age)\n",
    "- Drop unnecessary columns using drop()\n",
    "- Handle missing values using na.fill() or na.drop()\n",
    "- Cast columns to correct data types (e.g., age → Integer)\n",
    "- Add a new column (e.g., total votes = general + postal)\n",
    "- Sort candidates by total votes in descending order\n",
    "- Count total number of candidates, parties, or constituencies\n",
    "- Group by state or partyname and count candidates\n",

    "- Clean and standardize string columns (e.g., trim spaces in constituency)\n",
    "- Calculate total votes by partyname per state\n",
    "- Compute average age of candidates per party or constituency\n",
    "- Calculate voter turnout percentage per constituency\n",
    "- Find party-wise total votes and percentage share\n",
    "- Identify winner per constituency\n",
    "- Find top 3 candidates per constituency and calculate margin of victory\n",
    "- Rank parties by total votes per state\n",
    "- Create temp views and run SQL queries to analyze party performance\n",
    "- Build an end-to-end ETL pipeline (ingest → transform → aggregate → load)\n",
    "- Write aggregated results into Delta tables"
